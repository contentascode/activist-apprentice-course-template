# The audit toolkit module provides:
#  - Git version controlled activity modules in `~/.content`
#  - The dependency structure to bootstrap the workspace.
#    - Uses https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver#caret-ranges-123-025-004
#    - Using tilde in this context should mean that minor version changes of content packages might break transclusion structure.
#    - Major version changes should be locked to the `contentascode` major version.
#  - Offers the interface for the audit toolkit (i.e. activity planner).
# This is basically name resolution mappings
# to use shorthand names in metadata and transclusion.
