# Glossary

Let's define some of the language we'll be using throughout this documentation.

## Definitions

---

### People / Roles

## Readers

* The person intended to learn by reading a Course.

## Authors

* The person/people who write/create/adapt content for a Course.

## Publishers

* The person or persons responsible for configuring, publishing, and updating the Course. They need to be comfortable using a command line (or willing to learn!) and familiar with technical tools.

* It's helpful if this is one of the authors, but not required.

## Course Catalog Administrator

* Small World News is responsible for making Courses available in [Station](http://www.getstation.org).

* If you have created a Course and would like it to be made available in Station's [Course Catalog](https://smallworldnews.gitlab.io/station-repo/fdroid/repo/), please reach out to them.

### Information Organization

## Course Catalog

* The collection of Courses available in [Station](http://www.getstation.org).


## Course

* A complete collection of information (text and media) intended to educate a reader.

## Chapter

* A portion of a Course that covers a specific subject or topic. Can be made up of multiple sections but can also exist with just one chapter if needed. Chapters should be organized to create a logical flow of information from beginning to the end. Typically numbered individually (e.g. Chapter 1)

## Section

* A single unit that covers an individual piece of the larger subject or topic of the chapter it's in. Sections are made up of paragraphs of text and sometimes multimedia. A section is the base unit of a Course. Authors may choose to further organize them into sub sections. Typically numbered in relation to its corresponding chapter, (e.g. Chapter 1 section 1, or 1.1)

## Sub Section

* Small groups of text and images that make up the larger section. Made up of a sub section title, its corresponding text and maybe some multimedia. Typically they are not numbered, but if they are they would be given a third number, e.g. chapter 1, section 1, sub section 1, or 1.1.1)

### Technical Terms

---

## Repo

* What you use to store your course and the codebase around it. Each Course you create will need its own individual Repo, or *"Project"* on GitLab. This documentation exists as its own Repo, it's posted publicly at: [gitlab.com/contentascode/activist-apprentice-course-template](https://gitlab.com/contentascode/activist-apprentice-course-template)

## Folder

* Chapters are organized in a Course as folders on your computer. There are also folders named "images" which are used to store image assets.

## Page

* An individual markdown file, with the file extension of `.md`.

* Technically speaking these can be as long as the Author chooses, stylistically though Authors should split content up among multiple pages for easier reference.

## `index.md`

* Folders with a `index.md` file become Chapters.

* Folders without `index.md` files are not listed as chapters. Image folders do not get this file.
